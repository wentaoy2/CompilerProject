I basically followed the algorithm given in the appendix. For ADCE, I leave most of the skeleton unchanged and I only added a helper function markLive and doADCE which follows the algorithm given exactly. I use depth_first_ext to iterate in as dfs and I pass in a set to keep track of reachable blocks. For LICM I also followed the algorithm almost exactly. I wrote helper function safeToHoist and isLoopInvariant as the algorithm, and I also wrote Hoist function that is being called recursively for every node in dominated tree to hoist the block so we can traverse the tree with pre-order.
